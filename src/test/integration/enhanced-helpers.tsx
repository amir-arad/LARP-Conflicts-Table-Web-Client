/**
 * This file has been removed as its functionality is now covered by enhanced-helpers-fixed.tsx
 * which provides a more comprehensive and robust implementation including:
 * - Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
 * - More resilient element checks with fallbacks
 * - Comprehensive DOM manipulation capabilities
 * - Improved type safety
 * - Additional helper functions for testing
 *
 * All tests should use enhanced-helpers-fixed.tsx instead.
 * @deprecated Use enhanced-helpers-fixed.tsx instead
