## Timeline Summary

| Phase     | Description                             | Estimated Duration |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1         | Setup and Infrastructure                | 1-2 days           |

| 3         | Table Operations Tests                  | 2-3 days           |
| 4         | Collaboration Tests                     | 2-3 days           |
| 5         | Error Handling and Edge Cases           | 1-2 days           |
| 6         | Test Optimization and CI/CD Integration | 1-2 days           |
| **Total** |                                         | **8-14 days**      |

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Critical Paths First**: Focus on the most critical user flows first, such as authentication and basic table operations.
2. **Build on Success**: Each phase builds on the success of the previous phase, with increasing complexity.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and optimize tests to ensure they remain fast and reliable.

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Coverage**: Achieve at least 80% code coverage for the core application logic.
2. **Test Speed**: All integration tests should complete in under 5 minutes.
3. **Test Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and run automatically on each pull request.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                                                                    | Mitigation                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mock Complexity**: Mocks become too complex and hard to maintain                      | Keep mocks simple and focused on the specific behavior needed for tests                         |
| **Test Flakiness**: Tests become flaky due to timing issues                             | Use proper async/await patterns and avoid relying on timeouts                                   |
| **Slow Tests**: Tests become too slow to run regularly                                  | Focus on keeping tests fast and consider running subsets of tests in different CI jobs          |
| **Maintenance Burden**: Tests require too much maintenance when the application changes | Design tests to be resilient to UI changes by using semantic selectors and focusing on behavior |

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a structured approach to adding integration tests to the LARP Conflicts Table Web Client project. By following this plan, we can ensure that the tests are comprehensive, reliable, and maintainable.

The focus on fast tests that mock external dependencies will allow for quick feedback during development while still providing confidence that the application works as expected.
