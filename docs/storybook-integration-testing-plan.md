# Storybook Integration Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan for using Storybook as a central part of our integration testing strategy. We've already implemented the foundation with auth flow stories and a Vitest adapter, but we'll now expand this approach to cover more complex integration flows and enhance our testing capabilities.

## Current Implementation

We currently have:

1. **Auth Flow Stories**: Stories for different authentication states (initial, authenticating, authenticated, error)
2. **Simplified Components**: Simplified versions of our app components for Storybook
3. **Shared Fixtures**: Reusable fixtures for auth, sheet data, and presence
4. **Vitest Adapter**: A basic adapter to render stories in tests
5. **Storybook Test Runner**: Configuration for automated testing of stories

## Enhanced Integration Testing Approach

We'll expand our Storybook integration testing approach with the following enhancements:

### 1. Story-Driven Integration Tests

Instead of writing integration tests from scratch, we'll create Storybook stories that represent complete user flows and then use these stories as the foundation for our integration tests.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create stories for each key user flow (auth, table operations, collaboration)
2. Define story parameters that include test assertions and interactions
3. Use the Vitest adapter to render and test these stories
4. Enhance the adapter to support user interactions and assertions

### 2. Interactive Stories for User Flows

We'll create interactive stories that simulate user interactions and state changes, allowing us to visually test and document complex flows.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Use Storybook's play function to simulate user interactions
2. Create multi-step stories that demonstrate complete flows
3. Add state management to track flow progress
4. Implement visual indicators for each step in the flow

### 3. Enhanced Vitest Adapter

We'll enhance our Vitest adapter to better support integration testing with Storybook stories.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add support for story play functions in tests
2. Create helpers for common test operations
3. Implement a way to access story context and state in tests
4. Add support for testing asynchronous interactions

### 4. Presence and Collaboration Testing

We'll create specialized stories and test helpers for testing presence and collaboration features.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create stories that simulate multiple users
2. Implement mock presence updates
3. Add visual indicators for presence and locking
4. Create test helpers for verifying collaboration behavior

### 5. Table Operations Testing

We'll create stories and tests for table operations like adding/removing roles and conflicts, editing cells, etc.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create stories for each table operation
2. Implement play functions that simulate user interactions
3. Add assertions for expected state changes
4. Create test helpers for verifying table state

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Vitest Adapter (1 day)

1. Enhance the Vitest adapter to support play functions
2. Add helpers for common test operations
3. Implement a way to access story context and state in tests
4. Update existing tests to use the enhanced adapter

### Phase 2: Auth Flow Enhancement (1 day)

1. Add play functions to auth flow stories
2. Create multi-step auth flow stories
3. Update auth flow tests to use the enhanced stories
4. Add visual indicators for auth flow steps

### Phase 3: Table Operations Stories and Tests (2 days)

1. Create stories for adding/removing roles and conflicts
2. Implement stories for editing cells
3. Add stories for filtering and sorting
4. Create tests that use these stories

### Phase 4: Presence and Collaboration Stories and Tests (2 days)

1. Create stories that simulate multiple users
2. Implement mock presence updates
3. Add stories for cell locking and editing
4. Create tests for collaboration features

### Phase 5: Integration and Optimization (1 day)

1. Integrate all stories and tests
2. Optimize test performance
3. Add documentation
4. Set up CI/CD integration

## Benefits

This enhanced approach will provide several benefits:

1. **Visual Documentation**: Stories serve as living documentation of user flows
2. **Test Consistency**: Tests and documentation use the same fixtures and flows
3. **Developer Experience**: Easier to understand and debug complex flows
4. **Maintenance**: Changes to components automatically update tests and documentation
5. **Coverage**: More comprehensive testing of user flows
6. **Collaboration**: Better collaboration between developers, designers, and QA

## Next Steps

1. Create a detailed implementation plan for each phase
2. Assign tasks to team members
3. Set up tracking and progress reporting
4. Begin implementation with Phase 1

## Example: Enhanced Auth Flow Story

Here's an example of how we might enhance our auth flow story with play functions and assertions:

```tsx
export const AuthenticationFlow: Story = {
  decorators: [
    Story => (
      <StoryWrapper authState={authFixtures.initial}>
        <Story />
      </StoryWrapper>
    ),
  ],
  play: async ({ canvasElement, step }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement);

    // Step 1: Initial state - not logged in
    await step('Initial state', async () => {
      const loginButton = canvas.getByTestId('login-button');
      expect(loginButton).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    // Step 2: Click login button
    await step('Login', async () => {
      const loginButton = canvas.getByTestId('login-button');
      await userEvent.click(loginButton);

      // Update auth state to authenticating
      // This would be handled by the StoryWrapper in a real implementation
      await sleep(500);
    });

    // Step 3: Authenticating state
    await step('Authenticating', async () => {
      expect(canvas.getByText(/authenticating/i)).toBeInTheDocument();

      // Update auth state to authenticated
      // This would be handled by the StoryWrapper in a real implementation
      await sleep(500);
    });

    // Step 4: Authenticated state
    await step('Authenticated', async () => {
      expect(canvas.getByRole('table')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(
        canvas.getByRole('button', { name: /add conflict/i })
      ).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(
        canvas.getByRole('button', { name: /add role/i })
      ).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  },
};
```

This story would serve as both visual documentation and a test fixture, making it easier to understand and test the auth flow.
