# Real-Time Collaboration UX Plan

This document outlines the user experience design for collaborative features in the Conflicts Table application.

## 1. Presence Awareness

- Show who else is currently viewing the sheet
- Display avatars/names in a small overlay at the top
- Indicate when someone joins or leaves the session

## 2. Active Editing Indicators

- Show which cells are being edited and by whom
- Display a colored border or background around cells being edited
- Show user's cursor/avatar near the cell they're focusing on

## 3. Edit Lock Mechanism

- When a user starts editing a cell, temporarily lock it for others
- Show a visual indicator that the cell is being edited
- Display the editor's name in a tooltip
- Auto-release lock after short inactivity (e.g., 5 seconds)

## 4. Change Notifications

- Show toast notifications for important changes
- Examples:
  - "Alice added new role: Product Manager"
  - "Bob updated conflict description"
- Allow users to temporarily mute notifications

## 5. Conflict Resolution

- If two users try to edit the same cell simultaneously:
  - First editor gets priority
  - Second editor sees a notification
  - Show the pending change to the second editor
  - Provide option to "Update anyway" or "Discard changes"

## 6. History Trail

- Show recent changes in a collapsible sidebar
- Include who made each change and when
- Allow quick revert of recent changes
- Group related changes together

## 7. Smart Updates

- Batch multiple rapid changes together
- Show "X is typing..." for active edits
- Debounce updates to prevent flooding
- Progressive loading for large datasets

## 8. Collaborative Filtering

- Allow users to filter/sort without affecting others
- Show indicator when others are viewing filtered data
- Option to sync views between users
- Share specific views with colleagues

## 9. Session Management

- Ability to pause real-time updates
- Easy way to refresh/sync state manually
