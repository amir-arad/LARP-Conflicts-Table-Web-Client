# Files to Move

The following files need to be moved to the new structure:

1. Move `docs/documentation-generation-plan.md` to `docs/plans/static-code-documentation/documentation-generation-plan.md`

2. Move implementation files from `docs/implementation/` to `docs/plans/static-code-documentation/implementation/`:

   - `typedoc-config.md`
   - `jsdoc-config.md`
   - `compodoc-config.md`
   - `dependency-cruiser-config.md`
   - `plantuml-script.md`
   - `docs-integration-script.md`
   - `documentation-guidelines.md`
   - `ci-cd-workflow.md`
   - `package-json-scripts.md`

3. Move `docs/implementation-summary.md` to `docs/plans/static-code-documentation/implementation-summary.md`

Note: This is a record of the files that need to be moved. Since I can't directly move files, you'll need to move these files manually or use a file system operation to perform the moves.
