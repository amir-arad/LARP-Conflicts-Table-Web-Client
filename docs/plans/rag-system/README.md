# RAG System for Software Development AI Agents

This directory contains plans and documentation for implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system as an MCP API for software development AI agents.

The RAG system will leverage the generated documentation from the codebase to provide contextual information to AI agents, enhancing their ability to understand and work with the codebase.
