# Role Management Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the role management functionality, which currently has ~25% test coverage. We'll use the extended testing approach established in the motivation editing tests.

## Test Coverage Goals

- Increase role management test coverage from ~25% to 80%+
- Validate all role management operations
- Ensure proper error handling
- Verify collaborative scenarios

## Test Groups

### 1. Basic Role Management

- Adding new roles
  - Verify role creation
  - Validate role name constraints
  - Check table updates after role addition
- Removing roles
  - Verify role deletion
  - Check cascade effects on motivations
  - Validate table structure after removal

### 2. Role Data Persistence

- Verify role data is saved to Google Sheets
- Check role data is loaded correctly
- Validate role order preservation

### 3. Collaborative Role Management

- Multiple users adding roles simultaneously
- Role removal during collaborative session
- Role name conflicts resolution

### 4. Error Handling

- Network errors during role operations
- API errors during save/load
- Invalid role name handling
- Duplicate role handling

## Implementation Approach

### Test File Structure

Create `src/test/integration/role-management-flow-extended.test.tsx` with:

1. Extended test setup similar to motivation editing
2. Mock configurations for Google Sheets API
3. Collaborative session simulation
4. Error scenario handling

### Testing Methodology

1. Use `renderWithEnhancedWrapper` for consistent setup
2. Implement resilient checks with fallback mechanisms
3. Use Storybook integration for UI testing
4. Follow extended testing patterns

### Mock Requirements

1. Google Sheets API mocks for:
   - Role addition/removal operations
   - Data persistence operations
   - Error scenarios
2. Firebase mocks for:
   - Collaborative session management
   - Real-time updates

## Expected Results

- Comprehensive test coverage of role management functionality
- Validated role operations in various scenarios
- Verified error handling and recovery
- Confirmed collaborative features

## Success Criteria

1. All test groups passing
2. Coverage increase to 80%+
3. Proper error handling verification
4. Successful collaborative scenario testing
