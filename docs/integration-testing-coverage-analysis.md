# Integration Testing Coverage Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the process for analyzing our current test coverage and identifying gaps that should be addressed in our integration testing plan. Building on our successful authentication flow test optimization, we'll extend our approach to ensure comprehensive coverage across all critical system components.

## Current Coverage Status

Based on our test optimization work, we have:

- **Authentication Flow**: Well-covered with consolidated tests (61 tests, 100% coverage)
- **Presence Management**: Partially covered through auth flow tests
- **Table Interactions**: Limited coverage
- **Collaboration Features**: Limited coverage
- **Error Handling**: Partially covered

## Coverage Analysis Methodology

We will use a systematic approach to analyze our test coverage:

1. **Component Identification**: List all key components and features
2. **User Flow Mapping**: Document critical user flows
3. **Coverage Matrix**: Create a matrix of components vs. user flows
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify untested or under-tested areas
5. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize gaps based on risk

## Component Inventory

### Core Components

| Component           | Description                     | Current Test Coverage | Priority |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| Authentication      | User login/logout flow          | High (95%+)           | High     |
| Presence System     | User presence tracking          | Medium (~60%)         | High     |
| Conflicts Table     | Core table rendering            | Low (~30%)            | High     |
| Role Management     | Adding/removing roles           | Low (~25%)            | Medium   |
| Conflict Management | Adding/removing conflicts       | Low (~25%)            | Medium   |
| Motivation Editing  | Editing motivation cells        | Low (~20%)            | High     |
| Cell Locking        | Collaboration locking mechanism | Very Low (~10%)       | High     |
| Filters             | Role and conflict filtering     | Very Low (~5%)        | Medium   |
| Error Handling      | Error states and recovery       | Medium (~50%)         | High     |
| Network Resilience  | Handling network issues         | Low (~15%)            | High     |

### User Flows

1. **Authentication Flow**

   - User logs in
   - User establishes presence
   - User logs out

2. **Table Interaction Flow**

   - User views conflicts table
   - User adds/removes roles
   - User adds/removes conflicts
   - User edits motivations

3. **Collaboration Flow**

   - Multiple users establish presence
   - User locks a cell for editing
   - User edits and releases lock
   - User sees other users' active cells

4. **Error Recovery Flow**
   - User encounters network error
   - User recovers from authentication error
   - User handles API error

## Coverage Gap Summary

Based on our analysis, the following areas have the most significant coverage gaps:

1. **Collaboration Features**

   - Real-time presence updates
   - Cell locking mechanism
   - Concurrent editing scenarios
   - Lock timeout and recovery

2. **Table Interactions**

   - Adding/removing roles
   - Adding/removing conflicts
   - Editing motivation cells
   - Filtering and sorting

3. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Network error recovery
   - API error handling
   - State recovery after errors

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Implement in Phase 1)

   - Basic table interactions (view, add, edit)
   - Collaboration presence features
   - Cell locking mechanism
   - Critical error handling

2. **Medium Priority** (Implement in Phase 2)

   - Advanced table interactions (remove, reorder)
   - Filter functionality
   - Network resilience
   - Edge case handling

3. **Low Priority** (Implement if time permits)
   - Visual aspects
   - Performance testing
   - Rare edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed test plans for each high-priority gap
2. Enhance mock drivers to support the identified scenarios
3. Implement tests for high-priority gaps
4. Review and update coverage metrics
5. Proceed to medium and low priority items as time permits

## Coverage Metrics

We will track the following metrics to measure our progress:

1. **Component Coverage**: Percentage of components with tests
2. **User Flow Coverage**: Percentage of user flows with tests
3. **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
4. **Scenario Coverage**: Percentage of identified scenarios with tests
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Percentage of identified edge cases with tests
