# Authentication Flow Test Coverage Mapping

## Overview

This document maps test coverage from removed/consolidated files to their new locations, ensuring no functionality is lost during the optimization process.

## Removed Files Coverage

### auth-flow.test.tsx (Removed)

| Original Test                                       | New Location                                               | Coverage Details                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `happy path: user logs in and establishes presence` | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Basic Authentication Flow" | More comprehensive implementation with resilient checks and fallbacks     |
| `handles login error gracefully`                    | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Error Handling"            | Enhanced error handling with specific error types and recovery mechanisms |
| `maintains presence while user is active`           | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Token Management"          | Improved presence verification with heartbeat checks                      |

### auth-flow-story.test.tsx (Consolidated)

| Original Test                                          | New Location                                               | Coverage Details                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `should complete the authentication flow successfully` | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Basic Authentication Flow" | Using story-based approach with enhanced helpers     |
| `should show authenticated state after login`          | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Basic Authentication Flow" | More robust UI state verification                    |
| `should show error message when authentication fails`  | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Error Handling"            | Comprehensive error state verification               |
| `should establish presence after login`                | `auth-flow.unified.test.tsx` - "Basic Authentication Flow" | Enhanced presence verification with resilient checks |

### enhanced-helpers.tsx (Consolidated)

All helper functions have been consolidated into enhanced-helpers-fixed.tsx with improvements:

- Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- More resilient element checks with fallbacks
- Comprehensive DOM manipulation capabilities
- Improved type safety
- Additional helper functions for testing

## Coverage Verification Checklist

- [ ] Successfully authenticated
- [ ] Authentication error states
- [ ] Token expiration and refresh
- [ ] Session timeout

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Network errors
- [ ] Invalid credentials
- [ ] Token validation failures
- [ ] Permission denied
- [ ] Server errors
- [ ] Timeout errors

### UI States

- [ ] Loading indicators
- [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Success states
- [ ] Presence indicators
- [ ] User list display
- [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, forms)

### Multilingual Support

- [ ] Hebrew text verification
- [ ] English text verification
- [ ] RTL layout handling
- [ ] Language switching

### Security Features

- [ ] Token management
- [ ] Permission checks
- [ ] Session handling
- [ ] Secure storage

## Next Steps

1. Run test coverage analysis to verify no decrease in coverage
2. Execute all test scenarios to confirm functionality
3. Review error handling comprehensiveness
4. Validate UI state transitions
5. Update documentation with new test organization

## Coverage Metrics

**Target Coverage Levels:**

- Statements: 95%+
- Branches: 90%+
- Functions: 95%+
- Lines: 95%+

Current coverage metrics will be added after running coverage analysis in code mode.
