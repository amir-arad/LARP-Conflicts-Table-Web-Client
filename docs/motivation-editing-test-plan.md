# Motivation Editing Flow Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating an integration test for the motivation editing flow. Based on our coverage analysis, this is a high-priority area with limited current test coverage (~20%). We'll implement this test using the extended approach demonstrated in the auth-flow-extended.test.tsx file and integrate it with Storybook patterns.

## Test Coverage Goals

1. Basic Motivation Cell Editing
2. Cell Locking Mechanism
3. Collaborative Editing Scenarios
4. Error Handling in Motivation Editing

## Implementation Approach

### File Structure

Create a new test file: `src/test/integration/motivation-edit-flow-extended.test.tsx`

### Testing Methodology

1. Use the `renderWithEnhancedWrapper` helper for consistent test setup
2. Implement resilient checks with fallback mechanisms
3. Use Storybook integration for UI testing
4. Create detailed test groups focusing on different aspects of functionality

### Test Groups

#### Group 1: Basic Motivation Cell Editing

- Test editing a motivation cell
- Test updating a motivation cell value to the server
- Test clearing a motivation cell

#### Group 2: Cell Locking Mechanism

- Test locking a cell for editing
- Test editing with locked and unlocked cells
- Test lock timeout and automatic release

#### Group 3: Collaborative Editing Scenarios

- Test multiple users attempting to edit the same cell
- Test seeing other users' locked cells
- Test concurrent editing of different cells

#### Group 4: Error Handling

- Test handling network errors during motivation updates
- Test handling API errors during updates
- Test recovery from error states

### Implementation Details

1. Use the enhanced wrapper pattern from auth-flow-extended.test.tsx
2. Implement proper test isolation with beforeEach/afterEach cleanup
3. Use mocks for Firebase and Google Sheets APIs
4. Maintain consistent testing patterns with existing tests

## Expected Results

- A comprehensive test suite that ensures the motivation editing functionality works correctly
- Improved test coverage for the motivation editing flow from ~20% to 80%+
- Integration with existing testing patterns and infrastructure

## Contribution to Overall Coverage

This test implementation will directly address the "Editing motivation cells" gap identified in the coverage analysis document and contribute to the Table Interactions flow coverage.
