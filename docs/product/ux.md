# User Experience Design

This document describes the user experience principles and design considerations for the LARP Conflicts Table Tool.

## Key Principles

- **Clarity:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Efficiency:** Users should be able to quickly manage conflicts and motivations.
- **Collaboration:** The tool should facilitate real-time collaboration among multiple users.
- **Accessibility:** The application should be accessible to users with disabilities, including RTL support.

## User Flows

The primary user flows involve:

- [Authentication Flow](ux/authentication-flow)
- [Table Interaction Flow](ux/table-interaction)

**Collaboration Scenarios:**

- **Multiple users editing different cells:** Users can simultaneously edit different cells without conflict.
- **Multiple users attempting to edit the same cell:** The first user to start editing acquires a temporary lock. Subsequent users see a lock indicator and cannot edit the cell until the lock is released.
- **User disconnects while editing:** The cell lock is automatically released after a short period of inactivity.
