## Integration Testing Patterns for Complex UI Interactions

### Motivation Editing Test Approach

#### Key Testing Patterns

1. **Resilient Event Simulation**

   - Use of `userEvent` for realistic user interactions
   - Simulate complex event sequences (focus, input, blur)
   - Handle contenteditable elements with precise event dispatching

2. **Mock-Driven Testing**

   - Comprehensive mock setup for external APIs
   - Simulate error and success scenarios
   - Verify interaction flows through mock call inspections

3. **Extended Test Coverage**
   - Multiple test groups covering different interaction scenarios
   - Comprehensive error handling tests
   - Collaborative editing simulation

#### Implementation Techniques

- Use of `safeAct` for async test operations
- Detailed mock configuration
- Explicit error and success path testing
- Fallback mechanism for DOM element creation

### Recommended Patterns for Future Tests

- Use similar extended testing approach for other complex UI interactions
- Implement comprehensive mock drivers
- Create resilient test helpers that can handle various interaction scenarios
- Focus on simulating real-world user interactions

### Testing Anti-Patterns Avoided

- Avoid overly simplistic event simulation
- Prevent brittle tests that depend on exact implementation details
- Minimize hardcoded expectations

### Continuous Improvement Suggestions

- Regularly review and update test patterns
- Expand mock driver capabilities
- Develop more sophisticated event simulation techniques
