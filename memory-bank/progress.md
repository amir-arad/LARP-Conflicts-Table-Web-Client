- Completed third iteration of documentation reorganization:
  - Created detailed feature documentation files (authentication, conflicts table, real-time collaboration, internationalization)
  - Created user flow documentation files (authentication flow, table interaction)
  - Created component documentation files (conflicts table tool, contexts)
  - Created integration documentation files (Firebase, Google Sheets)
  - Added cross-references between all documentation files
  - Reviewed all documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness
- Created `docs/testing/google-oauth-testing.md` with instructions for obtaining Google access tokens for testing
- Created `docs/testing/integration-testing.md` summarizing the integration testing strategy and available tests
- Created comprehensive documentation generation build step plan:
  - Created detailed plan in `docs/documentation-generation-plan.md`
  - Created configuration templates for TypeDoc, JSDoc, Compodoc, Dependency Cruiser
  - Created script templates for PlantUML diagrams and documentation integration
  - Created documentation guidelines for JSDoc comments and diagrams
  - Created CI/CD workflow configuration for documentation generation
  - Created implementation summary with quick implementation steps
- Implemented documentation generation build step:
  - Created configuration files for TypeDoc, JSDoc, Compodoc, and Dependency Cruiser
  - Created script for generating PlantUML diagrams
  - Added npm scripts to package.json for documentation generation
  - Added JSDoc comments to key components and hooks
  - Generated documentation using TypeDoc, Compodoc, and PlantUML
  - Created an index page for navigating the generated documentation
  - Created documentation guide explaining how to use the build step
- Developed RAG system strategy for software development AI agents:
  - Created comprehensive strategy document in `docs/plans/rag-system/rag-system-strategy.md`
  - Designed architecture for document processing, vector database integration, and RAG query API
  - Provided example MCP server implementations for document processing and RAG queries
  - Outlined technical considerations for embedding models, chunking strategies, and vector database selection
  - Documented integration approaches with AI agent workflows
  - Established a plan for continuous improvement and maintenance

## Work in Progress

- Monitoring for any additional documentation needs based on project evolution

## Next Steps

1. Implement a proof-of-concept RAG MCP server for document processing
2. Experiment with different embedding models and chunking strategies
3. Implement basic semantic search functionality
4. Integrate the RAG system with the documentation generation process
5. Expand the RAG API with more specialized tools and resources
6. Add GraphViz installation for dependency graph generation
7. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automatic documentation generation
8. Add search functionality to the documentation website
9. Add versioning for documentation
10. Add more JSDoc comments to the codebase
11. Consider creating additional documentation for testing strategies and implementation guides
12. Keep documentation up-to-date with any new features or architectural changes
13. Continue following append-only strategy and synthesis-focused documentation rules
