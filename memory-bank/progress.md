# Progress

## Work Done

### February 25, 2025 - Auth Flow Interactive Fix

- Identified issue with auth-flow-interactive.stories.tsx where clicking on the login button doesn't advance the flow
- Analyzed the code and determined that the LoginScreen component in simplified-components.tsx doesn't have an onClick handler for the login button
- Created detailed documentation of the issue and proposed solution in docs/auth-flow-interactive-fix.md
- Developed a test plan in docs/auth-flow-interactive-test-plan.md to verify the fix
- Created a summary document in docs/auth-flow-interactive-summary.md
- Updated the Memory Bank with our findings and recommendations
- Implemented the fix by adding the onClick handler to the LoginScreen and ErrorScreen components
- Verified the fix by testing the interactive story in Storybook
- Created an automated test to verify the fix and ensure it continues to work in the future
- Updated the Memory Bank with our progress
