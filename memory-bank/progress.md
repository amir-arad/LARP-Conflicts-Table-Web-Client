## Work Done

- Completed role management integration test implementation
- Developed comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Basic role operations
  - Data persistence
  - Collaborative scenarios
  - Error handling
- Fixed test failures in role management tests
- Enhanced test infrastructure with resilient patterns
- Analyzed collaboration features implementation status
- Created detailed lock mechanism implementation plan
- Developed collaboration feature priority analysis
- Created comprehensive collaboration roadmap
- Identified potential issues with lock visualization features
- Created test plan for verifying lock visualization functionality
- Revised implementation priorities based on visual feedback
- Established Storybook-exclusive UI testing strategy
- Created detailed Storybook test story for lock visualization

## Next Steps

1. Verify and Fix Lock Visualization Features

   - Implement Storybook stories to verify lock visualization functionality
   - Set up Storybook interaction testing for lock visualization
   - Debug and fix UI issues with lock indicators and tooltips
   - Ensure visibility of lock state to all users

2. Convert Existing UI Tests to Storybook

   - Identify UI tests that should be migrated to Storybook
   - Create equivalent Storybook stories with interaction tests
   - Update testing documentation to reflect Storybook-exclusive approach
   - Configure Storybook addons for comprehensive testing

3. Implement Lock Mechanism (Story 2.3)

   - Create lock utilities for validation and management
   - Extend usePresence hook with lock functions
   - Create dedicated useLock hook for component integration
   - Integrate with table cell component
   - Implement TTL-based lock expiration
   - Create Storybook stories for lock mechanism behaviors

4. Prepare for Cursor Tracking Implementation (Story 2.4)

   - Design cursor overlay component architecture
   - Plan position tracking integration with presence system
   - Develop performance optimization strategy for cursor updates
   - Create Storybook design mock-ups for cursor tracking UI

5. Documentation

   - Update implementation docs for completed features
   - Document lock mechanism design decisions
   - Create Storybook-based testing guidelines for UI components
   - Document Storybook interaction testing best practices
