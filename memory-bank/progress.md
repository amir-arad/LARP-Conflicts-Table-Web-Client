## Stateful Google Sheets Mock Implementation

We have implemented a stateful Google Sheets mock with the following features:

1. **Core Functionality** ✓

   - Created a `StatefulSheetsAPI` class that implements the same interface as the current mock
   - Implemented in-memory storage using a 2D array
   - Implemented A1 to array coordinate translation utilities
   - Added support for core operations: get, update, clear
   - Created comprehensive test suite for the stateful mock
   - Updated the existing mock to use the new stateful implementation

2. **Enhanced Features** (Planned)

   - Add support for range operations
   - Implement error simulation
   - Add validation similar to the real API
   - Create helper methods for test setup and verification

3. **Integration with Test Framework** (Planned)
