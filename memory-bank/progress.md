# Project Progress

## Work Done

### Documentation Review

- [x] Reviewed test flows documentation
- [x] Reviewed backend setup documentation
- [x] Reviewed collaboration features documentation
- [x] Reviewed collaboration tasks and implementation status

### Code Review

- [x] Examined main application structure
- [x] Reviewed context providers (Auth, Firebase, GoogleSheets)
- [x] Analyzed hooks implementation (useConflictsTable, usePresence)
- [x] Studied UI components (ActiveUsersList, LockIndicator, etc.)

### Architecture Documentation

- [x] Created comprehensive project architecture overview
- [x] Established Memory Bank for project context
- [x] Documented product context and goals
- [x] Captured current session context and status

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. Review the implementation of lock validation utilities (next task in collab-tasks.todo)
2. Analyze the current implementation of cell editing UI
3. Document the approach for lock acquisition logic
4. Understand the TTL-based lock expiration mechanism
5. Review the lock release mechanisms

### Medium-term Tasks

1. Explore the implementation of live cursor indicators
2. Review error handling strategies
3. Analyze performance optimization opportunities
4. Document edge case handling approaches
5. Evaluate the testing strategy for collaboration features

### Long-term Tasks

1. Consider enhancements to the collaboration UX
2. Evaluate scalability of the current architecture
3. Identify potential improvements to the data synchronization approach
4. Consider additional features for the conflicts table tool
5. Explore integration with other LARP management tools

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the collab-tasks.todo file, the current implementation priorities are:

1. **Cell Editing UI (In Progress)**

   - [x] Add lock state visualizations
   - [x] Add tooltips for locked cells
   - [ ] Create lock validation utilities
   - [ ] Implement lock acquisition logic
   - [ ] Add TTL-based lock expiration
   - [ ] Add lock release mechanisms

2. **Live Cursor Indicators (Next)**

   - [ ] Create cursor overlay component
   - [ ] Add user identification to cursors
   - [ ] Style cursor indicators
   - [ ] Add cursor position tracking to presence system
   - [ ] Implement cursor position updates
   - [ ] Add cleanup on disconnect

3. **Polish & Performance (Future)**
   - [ ] Create user-facing error states
   - [ ] Implement connection error handling
   - [ ] Add retry mechanisms
   - [ ] Optimize presence updates
   - [ ] Add debouncing for cursor updates
   - [ ] Handle edge cases and concurrent scenarios
