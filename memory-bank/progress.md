## Next Steps

1. Verify and Fix Lock Visualization Features (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

   - Implement Storybook stories to verify lock visualization functionality
   - Test conditional rendering of lock indicators with mock data
   - Verify CSS specificity for lock indicators (border-red-400 class)
   - Check tooltip z-index and hover behavior
   - Fix visual issues with lock indicators and tooltips
   - Ensure visibility of lock state to all users
   - Create visual verification tests for each lock component state

2. Implement Documentation Reorganization

   - Create new directory structure according to plan
   - Move documents to their appropriate locations
   - Update cross-references between documents
   - Finalize and place README.md in docs directory
   - Update any references to documentation in code or workflows

3. Complete Lock Mechanism Implementation (Story 2.3)

   - Create lock validation utilities
   - Extend usePresence hook with lock functions
   - Create dedicated useLock hook for component integration
   - Implement lock acquisition logic
   - Integrate with table cell component
   - Implement TTL-based lock expiration
   - Add lock release mechanisms
   - Create Storybook stories for lock mechanism behaviors

4. Convert Existing UI Tests to Storybook

   - Identify UI tests that should be migrated to Storybook
   - Create equivalent Storybook stories with interaction tests
   - Update testing documentation to reflect Storybook-exclusive approach
   - Configure Storybook addons for comprehensive testing

5. Prepare for Cursor Tracking Implementation (Story 2.4)

   - Design cursor overlay component architecture
   - Plan position tracking integration with presence system
   - Develop performance optimization strategy for cursor updates
   - Create Storybook design mock-ups for cursor tracking UI

6. Documentation

   - Update implementation docs for completed features
   - Document lock mechanism design decisions
   - Create Storybook-based testing guidelines for UI components
   - Document Storybook interaction testing best practices
