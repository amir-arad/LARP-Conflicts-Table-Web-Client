## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. Implement enhanced mock drivers for integration tests
2. Create integration test helpers and setup
3. Implement auth flow integration tests
4. Review the implementation of lock validation utilities (next task in collab-tasks.todo)
5. Analyze the current implementation of cell editing UI

### Medium-term Tasks

1. Implement table operations integration tests
2. Implement collaboration feature integration tests
3. Document the approach for lock acquisition logic
4. Understand the TTL-based lock expiration mechanism
5. Review the lock release mechanisms

### Long-term Tasks

2. Optimize test performance and set up CI/CD integration
3. Explore the implementation of live cursor indicators
4. Review error handling strategies
5. Analyze performance optimization opportunities

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the collab-tasks.todo file and our integration testing plan, the current implementation priorities are:

1. **Integration Testing (New Priority)**

   - [ ] Create integration test helpers and setup
   - [ ] Implement auth flow integration tests
   - [ ] Implement table operations integration tests
   - [ ] Implement collaboration feature integration tests
   - [ ] Implement error handling and edge case tests
   - [ ] Optimize test performance and set up CI/CD integration

2. **Cell Editing UI (In Progress)**

   - [x] Add lock state visualizations
   - [x] Add tooltips for locked cells
   - [ ] Create lock validation utilities
   - [ ] Implement lock acquisition logic
   - [ ] Add TTL-based lock expiration
   - [ ] Add lock release mechanisms

3. **Live Cursor Indicators (Next)**

   - [ ] Create cursor overlay component
   - [ ] Add user identification to cursors
   - [ ] Style cursor indicators
   - [ ] Add cursor position tracking to presence system
   - [ ] Implement cursor position updates
   - [ ] Add cleanup on disconnect

4. **Polish & Performance (Future)**
   - [ ] Create user-facing error states
   - [ ] Implement connection error handling
   - [ ] Add retry mechanisms
   - [ ] Optimize presence updates
   - [ ] Add debouncing for cursor updates
   - [ ] Handle edge cases and concurrent scenarios

## Integration Testing Plan

We have created a comprehensive plan for implementing integration tests:

1. **Setup and Infrastructure** (1-2 days)

   - Create integration test directory structure
   - Enhance mock drivers
   - Configure Vitest for integration tests

2. **Auth Flow Tests** (1-2 days)

   - Implement "happy path" login test
   - Implement error handling tests
   - Implement presence management tests

3. **Table Operations Tests** (2-3 days)

   - Implement conflict management tests
   - Implement role management tests
   - Implement motivation management tests

4. **Collaboration Tests** (2-3 days)

   - Implement presence visualization tests
   - Implement cell locking tests
   - Implement multi-user interaction tests

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases** (1-2 days)

   - Implement network error tests
   - Implement API error tests
   - Implement edge case tests

6. **Test Optimization and CI/CD Integration** (1-2 days)
   - Optimize test performance
   - Set up CI/CD integration
   - Document and share knowledge

The estimated total time for implementation is 8-14 days.
