## Work Done

- Completed role management integration test implementation
- Developed comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Basic role operations
  - Data persistence
  - Collaborative scenarios
  - Error handling
- Fixed test failures in role management tests
- Enhanced test infrastructure with resilient patterns
- Analyzed collaboration features implementation status
- Created detailed lock mechanism implementation plan
- Developed collaboration feature priority analysis
- Created comprehensive collaboration roadmap
- Identified potential issues with lock visualization features
- Created test plan for verifying lock visualization functionality
- Revised implementation priorities based on visual feedback
- Established Storybook-exclusive UI testing strategy
- Created detailed Storybook test story for lock visualization
- Developed comprehensive test cases for verifying lock indicator components
- Created documentation reorganization plan with clear directory structure
- Drafted new documentation README for improved navigation
- Reviewed existing documentation files in `docs` and `docs/.archive` directories
- Analyzed codebase in `src` directory
- Summarized reconciliation findings for `docs/.archive/auth-flow-implementation.md`
- Created plan for updating `docs/.archive/auth-flow-implementation.md`
- Updated Memory Bank to reflect append-only strategy
- Created new file `docs/testing/integration/test-structure.md` with updated test structure documentation
- Created new file `docs/testing/integration/test-helpers.md` with enhanced test helpers documentation
- Created new file `docs/testing/integration/auth-flow-testing.md` with authentication flow testing documentation (initial draft)
- Updated Memory Bank again to reflect new documentation rules (no archive edits, no code transcription, focus on synthesis) and UMB operation
- Completed third iteration of documentation reorganization:
  - Created detailed feature documentation files (authentication, conflicts table, real-time collaboration, internationalization)
  - Created user flow documentation files (authentication flow, table interaction)
  - Created component documentation files (conflicts table tool, contexts)
  - Created integration documentation files (Firebase, Google Sheets)
  - Added cross-references between all documentation files
  - Reviewed all documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness
- Created `docs/testing/google-oauth-testing.md` with instructions for obtaining Google access tokens for testing
- Created `docs/testing/integration-testing.md` summarizing the integration testing strategy and available tests

## Work in Progress

- Monitoring for any additional documentation needs based on project evolution

## Next Steps

1. Consider creating additional documentation for testing strategies and implementation guides
2. Keep documentation up-to-date with any new features or architectural changes
3. Continue following append-only strategy and synthesis-focused documentation rules
