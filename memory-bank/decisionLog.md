## 2/26/2025 - Collaboration Feature Implementation Priority

**Context:** Analyzing the next steps for implementing real-time collaboration features in the Conflicts Table web client. Based on the collab-tasks.todo file, we needed to determine whether to prioritize completing the lock mechanism or implementing live cursor indicators.

**Decision:** Prioritize verifying and fixing the lock visualization features first, followed by completing the lock mechanism implementation. Defer cursor tracking to a later phase.

**Rationale:**

1. The task list specifies that "Stories must be completed in order within their Epic," indicating Story 2.3 (Cell Editing UI) should be completed before Story 2.4 (Live Cursor Indicators).
2. User feedback indicated that the supposedly completed lock visualization features (lock state visualization and tooltips) are not functioning correctly or are not visible to users.
3. Building the lock mechanism on top of faulty visualization would lead to a poor user experience.
4. Lock mechanism is essential for preventing data conflicts in collaborative editing, making it more critical than cursor indicators for basic functionality.

**Implementation:**

1. Create comprehensive test suite to verify lock visualization functionality (LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-PLAN.md)
2. Fix any issues with the existing lock visualization implementation
3. Proceed with lock mechanism implementation according to the plan (LOCK-MECHANISM-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)
4. Implement cursor tracking only after lock mechanism is fully functional

**Documentation:**

- Created COLLABORATION-FEATURE-ANALYSIS.md for feature priority analysis
- Created LOCK-MECHANISM-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for implementation details
- Created COLLABORATION-ROADMAP.md for long-term planning
- Created LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-PLAN.md for testing the visualization issues
- Created REVISED-IMPLEMENTATION-PRIORITY.md to address the visualization concerns

## 2/26/2025 - Storybook-Exclusive UI Testing Strategy

**Context:** We needed a more effective approach to testing UI components and flows, particularly for the lock visualization features where there appears to be a discrepancy between implementation and visible behavior.

**Decision:** Use Storybook exclusively for all flow tests involving UI components, moving away from traditional integration tests for UI verification.

**Rationale:**

1. Storybook provides direct visual verification of UI components and their states, making it easier to identify rendering issues
2. Interactive testing through Storybook's play function allows for comprehensive user flow testing in a controlled environment
3. Storybook serves as self-documenting UI component library, improving knowledge sharing and collaboration
4. Visual testing is more effective for identifying UI issues that might be missed in code-only tests
5. Isolated component testing leads to more focused, maintainable tests

**Implementation:**

1. Create comprehensive Storybook stories for all UI components
2. Implement interaction tests using Storybook's play function
3. Structure stories to test component states, user interactions, accessibility, and edge cases
4. Integrate Storybook testing into development workflow
5. Begin with lock visualization components as the first implementation of this approach

**Documentation:**

- Created STORYBOOK-EXCLUSIVE-UI-TESTING-PLAN.md to outline the strategy
- Updated LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-STORY.md to use Storybook exclusively
- Will update testing guidelines to reflect this strategic shift

## 2/26/2025 - Test-First Approach for Lock Visualization Verification

**Context:** The lock visualization components (border styling, lock icon, and tooltips) were reportedly implemented but are not visible to users in the application. We needed to determine the best approach to verify and fix these issues.

**Decision:** Adopt a test-first approach for verifying and fixing the lock visualization components, creating comprehensive Storybook tests before proceeding with fixes.

**Rationale:**

1. Creating tests first establishes clear verification criteria for success
2. Visual testing in Storybook provides immediate feedback on component rendering
3. Tests with mock data can isolate rendering issues from data flow problems
4. A systematic test approach helps identify specific issues (CSS, conditional rendering, etc.)
5. Tests serve as regression protection when implementing the actual lock mechanism

**Implementation:**

1. Create Storybook stories for each lock visualization component:
   - Table cell with lock border
   - Lock icon component
   - Lock tooltip with user information
2. Test multiple scenarios:
   - With/without lock state
   - Different users as lock owners
   - Various viewport sizes
3. Create interactive tests that simulate:
   - Lock acquisition flows
   - Hover states for tooltips
   - Multiple user interactions

**Technical Considerations:**

1. Key areas to test:
   - CSS specificity issues (border-red-400 class)
   - Conditional rendering logic
   - Z-index for tooltips
   - Data flow from presence system to UI components

**Documentation:**

- Added detailed test cases to LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-PLAN.md
- Will create LOCK-VISUALIZATION-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md to document findings

## 2/26/2025 - Documentation Reorganization Strategy

**Context:** The project documentation has grown considerably, with over 50 documentation files covering various aspects of the system. The current flat structure in the docs directory made it difficult to find relevant information quickly, especially for new team members.

**Decision:** Implement a comprehensive reorganization of the documentation folder with a clear hierarchy based on both feature areas and document types.

**Rationale:**

1. The flat structure was becoming unwieldy as the project documentation grew
2. Related documents were scattered, making it difficult to find comprehensive information on a topic
3. The naming conventions were inconsistent, with some files using dashes and others using underscores
4. New team members reported difficulty in finding relevant documentation
5. A structured approach will support future documentation growth

**Implementation:**

1. Create a new hierarchical structure with the following main sections:

   - architecture/ - System architecture and design documents
   - testing/ - Testing strategy and implementation details
   - features/ - Feature-specific documentation
   - backends/ - Backend integration documents

2. Move existing documents to their appropriate locations based on content
3. Create a main README.md to serve as a navigation index
4. Maintain consistent naming conventions within each section

**Technical Considerations:**

1. The restructuring will be done in a single commit to minimize disruption
2. Cross-references between documents will need to be updated
3. Temporary symbolic links may be used if there are hard references to old paths
4. CI/CD scripts that reference documentation paths will need to be updated

**Documentation:**

- Created DOCS-REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md detailing the new structure and file movements
- Created README-DRAFT.md as a template for the main documentation index
