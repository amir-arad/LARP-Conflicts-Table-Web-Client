## 2025-02-28 - Update Memory Bank (UMB) - New Documentation Rules

**Context:** User provided new rules for documentation updates: 1) Do not edit files in `.archive` folder, 2) Do not transcribe code, focus on synthesis and high-level insights. User also requested another UMB operation.

**Decision:** Update Memory Bank files to reflect the new documentation rules and adjust documentation approach to focus on synthesis and high-level insights, avoiding code transcription and archive edits.

**Rationale:** To comply with user's new instructions and ensure Memory Bank reflects the updated documentation strategy.

**Implementation:**

1.  **Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`**: Clear current session context and add notes about new documentation rules and UMB operation (second iteration).
2.  **Update `memory-bank/progress.md`**: Add new entries for work done in this session, including updating documentation approach and performing UMB operation again.
3.  **Create this entry in `decisionLog.md`**: Document the new documentation rules and the adjustment in documentation approach.

**Confirmation:** Memory Bank files (`memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/progress.md`, `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`) updated to reflect new documentation rules and current task status (second iteration of UMB).

## 2025-02-28 - Documentation Reorganization - Third Iteration

**Context:** Need to reorganize documentation to improve knowledge management and discoverability, following the new documentation rules focusing on synthesis and high-level insights.

**Decision:** Create a hierarchical documentation structure with separate files for features, user flows, components, and integrations, with cross-references between related documents.

**Rationale:**

- Clear separation of concerns makes documentation easier to navigate
- Feature-specific files provide focused, detailed information
- User flow documentation helps understand the application from a user's perspective
- Component documentation aids developers in understanding the codebase
- Integration documentation details external service interactions
- Cross-references help users find related information

**Implementation:**

1. Create feature documentation files:
   - `docs/product/features/authentication.md`
   - `docs/product/features/conflicts-table.md`
   - `docs/product/features/real-time-collaboration.md`
   - `docs/product/features/internationalization.md`
2. Create user flow documentation:
   - `docs/product/ux/authentication-flow.md`
   - `docs/product/ux/table-interaction.md`
3. Create component documentation:
   - `docs/architecture/components/conflicts-table-tool.md`
   - `docs/architecture/components/auth-context.md`
   - `docs/architecture/components/firebase-context.md`
   - `docs/architecture/components/google-sheets-context.md`
   - `docs/architecture/components/language-context.md`
4. Create integration documentation:
   - `docs/architecture/firebase-integration.md`
   - `docs/architecture/google-sheets-integration.md`
5. Add cross-references between related documents
6. Review all documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness

**Confirmation:** Documentation reorganization completed with all planned files created and cross-referenced.

## 2025-02-28 - Create Integration Testing Documentation

**Context:** Need to document the integration testing strategy and available tests for the application.

**Decision:** Create a new file `docs/testing/integration-testing.md` to summarize the testing strategy, available tests, and how to run them.

**Rationale:**

- Provides a central location for information about integration testing
- Helps developers understand the testing approach and how to contribute
- Improves the discoverability of testing-related information

**Implementation:**

1. Analyze the existing integration tests in `src/test/integration/`
2. Analyze the Storybook stories in `src/test/storybook/`
3. Create a new file `docs/testing/integration-testing.md` with a summary of the testing strategy and available tests

**Confirmation:** Integration testing documentation created in `docs/testing/integration-testing.md`.

## 2025-02-28 - Documentation Generation Build Step

**Context:** Need to create a build step that automatically generates all possible documentation from the source code, including TypeScript type definitions, JSDoc comments, API documentation, dependency graphs, code coverage reports, and architectural diagrams.

**Decision:** Create a comprehensive plan for implementing an automated documentation generation build step using tools like TypeDoc, JSDoc, Compodoc, Dependency Cruiser, PlantUML, and Docusaurus.

**Rationale:**

- Automated documentation generation ensures documentation stays up-to-date with code changes
- Comprehensive documentation improves developer onboarding and project maintenance
- Structured documentation with cross-references enhances discoverability
- Visual representations like diagrams and dependency graphs improve understanding of the codebase
- Code coverage reports provide insights into test coverage

**Implementation:**

1. Create a comprehensive documentation generation plan in `docs/documentation-generation-plan.md`
2. Create configuration templates for documentation generation tools:
   - `docs/implementation/typedoc-config.md` for TypeDoc
   - `docs/implementation/jsdoc-config.md` for JSDoc
   - `docs/implementation/compodoc-config.md` for Compodoc
   - `docs/implementation/dependency-cruiser-config.md` for Dependency Cruiser
3. Create script templates:
   - `docs/implementation/plantuml-script.md` for PlantUML diagrams
   - `docs/implementation/docs-integration-script.md` for documentation integration
4. Create documentation guidelines in `docs/implementation/documentation-guidelines.md`
5. Create CI/CD workflow configuration in `docs/implementation/ci-cd-workflow.md`
6. Create implementation summary with quick implementation steps in `docs/implementation-summary.md`

**Confirmation:** Documentation generation build step plan and implementation templates created. The plan provides a comprehensive approach to automatically generating documentation from the source code and organizing it in a searchable, well-structured format.

## 2025-02-28 - Documentation Generation Build Step Implementation

**Context:** Need to implement the documentation generation build step based on the plan created earlier.

**Decision:** Implement the documentation generation build step using TypeDoc, JSDoc, Compodoc, and PlantUML.

**Rationale:**

- Automated documentation generation improves developer onboarding and project maintenance
- JSDoc comments provide valuable context for developers working with the codebase

   - `src/components/conflicts-table-tool.tsx`
   - `src/hooks/useConflictsTable.ts`
5. Generate documentation:
   - TypeDoc API documentation
   - Compodoc component documentation
   - PlantUML diagrams
   - Code coverage reports
6. Create an index page for navigating the generated documentation

## 2025-03-01 - RAG System Strategy for Software Development AI Agents

**Context:** The generated documentation from the codebase can serve as a stepping stone for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for software development AI agents. Since the agent flow frameworks only offer extendability through MCP tools, the RAG system needs to be implemented as an MCP API.

**Decision:** Develop a comprehensive strategy for implementing a RAG system as an MCP API for software development AI agents, leveraging the generated documentation from the codebase.

**Rationale:**

- A RAG system would enhance AI agents' ability to understand and work with the codebase
- The generated documentation provides a rich source of information about the codebase
- Implementing the RAG system as an MCP API aligns with the agent flow frameworks' extensibility model
- The approach leverages the existing documentation generation pipeline

**Implementation:**

1. Create a comprehensive strategy document in `docs/plans/rag-system/rag-system-strategy.md`
2. Design architecture for:
   - Document processing
   - Vector database integration
   - RAG query API
3. Provide example MCP server implementations for:
   - Document processing
   - RAG queries
4. Outline technical considerations for:
   - Embedding models
   - Chunking strategies
   - Vector database selection
5. Document integration approaches with AI agent workflows:
   - Code understanding
   - Implementation assistance
   - Debugging support
   - Architecture planning
6. Establish a plan for continuous improvement and maintenance

**Confirmation:** RAG system strategy document created in `docs/plans/rag-system/rag-system-strategy.md`. The strategy provides a comprehensive approach to implementing a RAG system as an MCP API for software development AI agents, leveraging the generated documentation from the codebase.
