## 2/26/2025 - Collaboration Feature Implementation Priority

**Context:** Analyzing the next steps for implementing real-time collaboration features in the Conflicts Table web client. Based on the collab-tasks.todo file, we needed to determine whether to prioritize completing the lock mechanism or implementing live cursor indicators.

**Decision:** Prioritize verifying and fixing the lock visualization features first, followed by completing the lock mechanism implementation. Defer cursor tracking to a later phase.

**Rationale:**

1. The task list specifies that "Stories must be completed in order within their Epic," indicating Story 2.3 (Cell Editing UI) should be completed before Story 2.4 (Live Cursor Indicators).
2. User feedback indicated that the supposedly completed lock visualization features (lock state visualization and tooltips) are not functioning correctly or are not visible to users.
3. Building the lock mechanism on top of faulty visualization would lead to a poor user experience.
4. Lock mechanism is essential for preventing data conflicts in collaborative editing, making it more critical than cursor indicators for basic functionality.

**Implementation:**

1. Create comprehensive test suite to verify lock visualization functionality (LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-PLAN.md)
2. Fix any issues with the existing lock visualization implementation
3. Proceed with lock mechanism implementation according to the plan (LOCK-MECHANISM-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)
4. Implement cursor tracking only after lock mechanism is fully functional

**Documentation:**

- Created COLLABORATION-FEATURE-ANALYSIS.md for feature priority analysis
- Created LOCK-MECHANISM-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for implementation details
- Created COLLABORATION-ROADMAP.md for long-term planning
- Created LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-PLAN.md for testing the visualization issues
- Created REVISED-IMPLEMENTATION-PRIORITY.md to address the visualization concerns

## 2/26/2025 - Storybook-Exclusive UI Testing Strategy

**Context:** We needed a more effective approach to testing UI components and flows, particularly for the lock visualization features where there appears to be a discrepancy between implementation and visible behavior.

**Decision:** Use Storybook exclusively for all flow tests involving UI components, moving away from traditional integration tests for UI verification.

**Rationale:**

1. Storybook provides direct visual verification of UI components and their states, making it easier to identify rendering issues
2. Interactive testing through Storybook's play function allows for comprehensive user flow testing in a controlled environment
3. Storybook serves as self-documenting UI component library, improving knowledge sharing and collaboration
4. Visual testing is more effective for identifying UI issues that might be missed in code-only tests
5. Isolated component testing leads to more focused, maintainable tests

**Implementation:**

1. Create comprehensive Storybook stories for all UI components
2. Implement interaction tests using Storybook's play function
3. Structure stories to test component states, user interactions, accessibility, and edge cases
4. Integrate Storybook testing into development workflow
5. Begin with lock visualization components as the first implementation of this approach

**Documentation:**

- Created STORYBOOK-EXCLUSIVE-UI-TESTING-PLAN.md to outline the strategy
- Updated LOCK-VISUALIZATION-TEST-STORY.md to use Storybook exclusively
- Will update testing guidelines to reflect this strategic shift
