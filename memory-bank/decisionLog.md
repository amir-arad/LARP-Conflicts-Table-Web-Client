## 2025-02-28 - Restart Documentation Re-organization

**Context:** Previous attempt at documentation re-organization was not successful, resulting in a folder hierarchy and placeholder files but no significant improvement in knowledge management. User feedback indicates a need for a more cautious, step-by-step approach, with less automatic conclusions and ambiguity.

**Decision:** Restart the documentation re-organization task with a focus on iterative steps, thorough analysis, and clear goal definition before implementation. Remove previous task-specific context from memory bank to ensure a fresh start.

**Rationale:** The previous attempt was too broad and automated, failing to address the underlying issues with the documentation structure. A more deliberate, step-by-step approach will allow for better analysis, clearer goals, and more effective implementation. Starting fresh in the memory bank will prevent carrying over potentially flawed assumptions or conclusions from the previous attempt.

**Implementation:**

1.  **Memory Bank Update:**
    - Clear `activeContext.md` to remove previous session context.
    - Update `progress.md` to reflect the restart of the documentation re-organization task.
    - Create this entry in `decisionLog.md` to document the decision and rationale.
2.  **New Task Approach:**
    - Begin with an analysis of the current documentation structure.
    - Define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for the re-organization.
    - Develop a detailed, step-by-step plan before making any changes to the documentation.
    - Implement changes iteratively, seeking feedback and validation at each step.
