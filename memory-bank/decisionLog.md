## 2/25/2025 - Motivation Editing Integration Test Implementation

**Context:**

- Identified gaps in test coverage for motivation editing functionality
- Need for comprehensive integration testing of table interaction flows

**Decision:**
Implement an extended integration test suite for motivation editing with the following key characteristics:

- Use resilient testing approach similar to authentication flow tests
- Cover multiple scenarios including basic editing, cell locking, and error handling
- Implement mock-based testing with detailed event simulation
- Ensure proper error recovery and retry mechanisms

**Rationale:**

- Improve test coverage from ~20% to 80%+
- Validate complex interaction patterns in collaborative editing
- Provide robust testing for critical table interaction features
- Establish a pattern for future integration tests

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `motivation-edit-flow-extended.test.tsx`
- Implemented test groups:
  1. Basic Motivation Cell Editing
  2. Cell Locking Mechanism
  3. Collaborative Editing Scenarios
  4. Error Handling

**Challenges Addressed:**

- Proper event simulation for contenteditable elements
- Handling of mock updates with error scenarios
- Verifying complex interaction flows

**Potential Future Improvements:**

- Expand edge case testing
- Add more granular error scenario tests
- Improve mock driver flexibility
