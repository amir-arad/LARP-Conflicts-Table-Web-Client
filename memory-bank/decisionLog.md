## 2/25/2025 - Role Management Test Implementation

**Context:**

- Role management tests had low coverage (~25%)
- Critical functionality for table interactions
- Need for comprehensive testing approach

**Decisions Made:**

1. Implement Extended Testing Approach

   - Use resilient testing patterns
   - Create comprehensive test scenarios
   - Focus on real-world use cases

2. Test Coverage Strategy
   - Target 80%+ coverage
   - Validate core role management operations
   - Implement robust error handling

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Developed tests for:
  - Basic role addition/removal
  - Data persistence verification
  - Collaborative editing scenarios
  - Error handling and recovery

**Technical Challenges Addressed:**

1. Async Test Handling

   - Implemented safeAct for reliable async operations
   - Created robust mock management
   - Handled complex event sequences

2. Error Scenario Testing
   - Network interruption simulation
   - API error recovery mechanisms
   - Concurrent editing validation

**Rationale:**

- Improve system reliability
- Validate core collaboration features
- Ensure robust error handling
- Provide comprehensive test coverage

**Outcomes:**

- Increased role management test coverage
- Identified and fixed potential edge cases
- Established consistent testing methodology
- Improved overall system resilience

**Future Recommendations:**

1. Continue expanding test coverage
2. Develop more sophisticated mock drivers
3. Create reusable testing patterns
4. Implement performance testing scenarios
