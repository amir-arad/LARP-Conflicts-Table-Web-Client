## Product Testing Strategy: Integration Test Coverage

### Current Testing Focus

- Motivation Editing Functionality
- Collaborative Table Interaction Flows
- Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms

### Test Coverage Goals

- Increase motivation editing test coverage from ~20% to 80%+
- Validate complex interaction patterns
- Ensure robust error handling
- Simulate real-world collaborative editing scenarios

### Key Components Tested

1. **Motivation Cell Editing**

   - Basic editing operations
   - Content updates
   - Input validation

2. **Cell Locking Mechanism**

   - Lock acquisition
   - Concurrent editing prevention
   - Lock release and timeout handling

3. **Collaborative Editing**

   - Multiple user interaction scenarios
   - Presence management
   - Conflict resolution

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network interruption recovery
   - API error scenarios
   - Retry mechanisms

### Testing Approach

- Extended integration testing
- Mock-driven development
- Comprehensive scenario coverage
- Resilient test design

### Upcoming Testing Phases

1. Complete motivation editing test suite
2. Expand to other table interaction flows
3. Develop more sophisticated mock drivers
4. Implement edge case and performance testing

### Long-term Testing Strategy

- Continuous test coverage improvement
- Develop reusable testing patterns
- Create comprehensive mock ecosystem
- Implement automated coverage reporting

### Metrics to Track

- Test coverage percentage
- Number of scenarios tested
- Error handling effectiveness
- Performance of mock-based testing
