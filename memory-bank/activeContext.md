### Project Context

[To be preserved - project overview and long-term goals]

### Current Task

Documentation Re-organization - Third Iteration

### Task Goal

To improve the documentation structure for better knowledge management and discoverability, learning from previous attempts and using an append-only strategy for documentation updates, focusing on synthesis and high-level insights rather than code transcription.

### Current Status

Completed documentation reorganization:

- Created detailed feature documentation files
- Created user flow documentation files
- Created component documentation files
- Created integration documentation files
- Added cross-references between documents
- Reviewed all documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness

### Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any documentation needs based on project evolution.
2. Consider creating additional documentation for testing strategies and implementation guides.
3. Keep documentation up-to-date with any new features or architectural changes.

### Notes

- Using append-only strategy for documentation updates.
- New documentation rules: No archive edits, no code transcription, focus on synthesis and high-level insights.
- Documentation now follows a clear hierarchy with cross-references.
