## Project Status

Initial implementation phase. The project is a LARP Conflicts Table Web Client with real-time collaboration features. The application is functional with core features implemented and collaboration features in progress. We are now implementing fast integration tests, starting with the auth flow test, and have decided to use Storybook for integration test fixtures. We have successfully implemented the stateful Google Sheets mock with in-memory state to support complex integration test scenarios.

## Open Questions

1. What is the current priority for the remaining collaboration features?
2. Are there any performance concerns with the current implementation?
3. How should the lock validation utilities be implemented?
4. What is the expected behavior for network disconnections during editing?
5. Are there any specific accessibility requirements to consider?
6. Should we prioritize certain test flows over others for the integration tests?
7. Are there any specific edge cases that should be covered in the integration tests?
8. How should we handle test data management for integration tests?
9. How can we best leverage Storybook for both visual documentation and automated testing?
10. What is the best way to share fixtures between Storybook and integration tests?
11. ~~How should we handle complex operations like range updates in the stateful Google Sheets mock?~~ (Implemented basic range operations)
12. What level of fidelity to the real Google Sheets API is necessary for effective testing?

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing fast integration tests for the project, starting with the auth flow test. The auth flow test implementation has been routed to the TDD Integration Maestro mode, which will follow TDD principles to create the test.

We have decided to use Storybook for integration test fixtures, which will allow us to create a shared library of test scenarios that can be used for both visual documentation and automated testing. This approach will improve test maintainability, provide better documentation, and enhance the developer experience.

We have successfully implemented a stateful Google Sheets mock with in-memory state to support complex integration test scenarios that require state consistency across multiple operations. This mock maintains A1 notation in its public API to match the application's usage while using an internal translation layer to simplify implementation. The mock has been integrated with the existing test infrastructure and is ready for use in integration tests.

The next steps are to implement the Storybook integration test fixtures approach and create a shared fixtures library for integration tests. We will also continue to enhance the stateful Google Sheets mock with more advanced features like range operations and error simulation.

We are also continuing to understand the cell editing UI and lock mechanism implementation, which is the next task in the collaboration features roadmap according to the collab-tasks.todo file.

## Key Insights

- The application uses a decentralized architecture with Google Sheets as the source of truth and Firebase for real-time features
- Optimistic UI locking is used for concurrency control
- The project has a well-structured test suite with specific test flows
- Internationalization is implemented with support for English and Hebrew
- The collaboration features are being implemented incrementally with a clear roadmap
- The project already has a solid foundation for mocking external dependencies
- Vitest with JSDOM is the most suitable approach for fast integration tests
- The auth flow is a critical path that should be tested first
- The existing mock drivers need enhancements to better support integration testing
- A phased implementation approach will allow for incremental progress and feedback
- The TDD Task Router's role is to coordinate and route tasks to specialized modes
- The TDD Integration Maestro is responsible for implementing integration tests
- Storybook is already set up in the project and can be leveraged for test fixtures
- Sharing fixtures between Storybook and tests will reduce duplication and improve consistency
- Visual development of test fixtures will make it easier to understand and debug complex scenarios
- The previous Google Sheets mock was insufficient for complex user flows that involve multiple operations
- Our new stateful mock with in-memory state better simulates real Google Sheets behavior
- A1 notation is used in the public API to match the application's usage, with internal translation to array coordinates

## Integration Testing Plan

We have created a comprehensive plan for implementing integration tests, now enhanced with Storybook integration and stateful Google Sheets mock:

1. **Setup and Infrastructure** (1-2 days)

   - Create integration test directory structure ✓
   - Implement Storybook integration test fixtures approach
   - Create shared fixtures library
