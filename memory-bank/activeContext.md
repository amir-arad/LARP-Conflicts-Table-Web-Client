### Project Context

[To be preserved - project overview and long-term goals]

### Current Task

RAG System Strategy for Software Development AI Agents

### Task Goal

To develop a comprehensive strategy for implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system as an MCP API for software development AI agents, leveraging the generated documentation from the codebase.

### Current Status

Completed RAG system strategy planning:

- Created a comprehensive strategy document for implementing a RAG system as an MCP API
- Designed architecture for document processing, vector database integration, and RAG query API
- Provided example MCP server implementations for document processing and RAG queries
- Outlined technical considerations for embedding models, chunking strategies, and vector database selection
- Documented integration approaches with AI agent workflows
- Established a plan for continuous improvement and maintenance

Previous accomplishment:
Completed documentation generation build step implementation:

- Created configuration files for TypeDoc, JSDoc, Compodoc, and Dependency Cruiser
- Created script for generating PlantUML diagrams
- Added npm scripts to package.json for documentation generation
- Added JSDoc comments to key components and hooks
- Generated documentation using TypeDoc, Compodoc, and PlantUML
- Created an index page for navigating the generated documentation
- Created documentation guide explaining how to use the build step

### Next Steps

1. Implement a proof-of-concept RAG MCP server for document processing
2. Experiment with different embedding models and chunking strategies
3. Implement basic semantic search functionality
4. Integrate with the documentation generation process
5. Expand the API with more specialized tools and resources

Documentation generation improvements:

1. Add GraphViz installation for dependency graph generation
2. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automatic documentation generation
3. Add search functionality to the documentation website
4. Add versioning for documentation
5. Add more JSDoc comments to the codebase

### Notes

- The RAG system strategy builds upon the existing documentation generation build step
- The implementation will enable AI agents to better understand the codebase and provide more contextually relevant assistance
- The MCP API approach aligns with the agent flow frameworks' extensibility model
- The strategy includes both immediate implementation steps and a long-term vision for continuous improvement
