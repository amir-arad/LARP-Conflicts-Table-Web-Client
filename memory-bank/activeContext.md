## Project Status

Initial implementation phase. The project is a LARP Conflicts Table Web Client with real-time collaboration features. The application is functional with core features implemented and collaboration features in progress. We are now implementing fast integration tests, starting with the auth flow test, and have successfully implemented the Storybook integration test fixtures approach. We have also implemented the stateful Google Sheets mock with in-memory state to support complex integration test scenarios. The authenticated auth flow Storybook story has been successfully created and is accessible at http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/integration-tests-auth-flow--authenticated. We have now enhanced our Storybook integration testing approach with interactive stories and play functions, providing a more comprehensive and maintainable approach to integration testing.

We have successfully fixed the issue with the auth-flow-interactive.stories.tsx file where clicking on the login button wasn't advancing the flow. We've implemented the fix, created automated tests, and verified that everything is working correctly.

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing fast integration tests for the project, starting with the auth flow test. The auth flow test implementation has been routed to the TDD Integration Maestro mode, which will follow TDD principles to create the test.

We have successfully implemented the Storybook integration test fixtures approach, which allows us to create a shared library of test scenarios that can be used for both visual documentation and automated testing. This approach improves test maintainability, provides better documentation, and enhances the developer experience.

We have also implemented a stateful Google Sheets mock with in-memory state to support complex integration test scenarios that require state consistency across multiple operations. This mock maintains A1 notation in its public API to match the application's usage while using an internal translation layer to simplify implementation. The mock has been integrated with the existing test infrastructure and is ready for use in integration tests.

The Storybook story for the authenticated auth flow has been successfully created and is accessible at http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/integration-tests-auth-flow--authenticated. This story demonstrates the application in an authenticated state, showing the conflicts table with sample data and active users. The story uses the auth fixtures to simulate an authenticated user with a valid access token and Firebase user object.

We have now enhanced our Storybook integration testing approach with interactive stories and play functions, providing a more comprehensive and maintainable approach to integration testing. The enhanced approach includes:

1. **Enhanced Vitest Adapter**: We've enhanced the Vitest adapter to support play functions and provide better test helpers, making it easier to write and maintain integration tests.

2. **Interactive Auth Flow Stories**: We've created interactive auth flow stories with play functions that demonstrate the complete authentication flow, providing better visual documentation and test fixtures.

3. **Story-Helpers Module**: We've implemented a story-helpers module that integrates our enhanced Storybook approach with the existing integration test infrastructure, providing a smooth migration path for existing tests.

4. **Story-Driven Integration Tests**: We've created integration tests that use our Storybook stories as fixtures, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

We have successfully fixed the issue with the auth-flow-interactive.stories.tsx file where clicking on the login button wasn't advancing the flow. We identified that the issue was in the LoginScreen component in simplified-components.tsx, which didn't have an onClick handler for the login button. We implemented the fix by adding the onClick handlers to both the LoginScreen and ErrorScreen components, connecting them to the login function from the auth context. We also created automated tests to verify the fix and ensure it continues to work in the future.

The next steps are to continue enhancing the integration tests with more scenarios and to implement table operations and collaboration feature tests. We will also continue to enhance the stateful Google Sheets mock with more advanced features like error simulation.

We are also continuing to understand the cell editing UI and lock mechanism implementation, which is the next task in the collaboration features roadmap according to the collab-tasks.todo file.

## Auth Flow Interactive Issue Fix

We have successfully fixed the issue with the auth-flow-interactive.stories.tsx file where clicking on the login button wasn't advancing the flow. The fix involved:

1. Adding the missing onClick handlers to the LoginScreen and ErrorScreen components in simplified-components.tsx
2. Connecting the onClick handlers to the login function from the auth context
3. Creating automated tests to verify the fix
4. Adjusting the tests to match the actual component behavior

The fix was straightforward and focused on the root cause of the issue. The interactive auth flow story now works as expected, providing a comprehensive demonstration of the authentication flow in the application. The automated tests also pass, ensuring that the fix will continue to work in the future.
