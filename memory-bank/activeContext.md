## Project Status

Initial implementation phase. The project is a LARP Conflicts Table Web Client with real-time collaboration features. The application is functional with core features implemented and collaboration features in progress. We are now planning to add fast integration tests to the project.

## Recent Activities

- Reviewed all available documentation in the docs directory
- Examined key source files to understand implementation details
- Created project architecture overview document
- Established Memory Bank for project context tracking
- Created comprehensive plan for implementing integration tests
- Developed detailed implementation guide for auth flow tests
- Identified necessary enhancements to mock drivers
- Created implementation timeline and testing considerations

## Current Goals

- Complete comprehensive understanding of the project architecture
- Identify potential areas for improvement or enhancement
- Prepare for upcoming implementation tasks
- Document key architectural patterns and decisions
- Implement fast integration tests for the project
- Ensure tests cover the entire system except for external API drivers

## Open Questions

1. What is the current priority for the remaining collaboration features?
2. Are there any performance concerns with the current implementation?
3. How should the lock validation utilities be implemented?
4. What is the expected behavior for network disconnections during editing?
5. Are there any specific accessibility requirements to consider?
6. Should we prioritize certain test flows over others for the integration tests?
7. Are there any specific edge cases that should be covered in the integration tests?
8. How should we handle test data management for integration tests?

## Current Focus

The current focus is on planning and implementing fast integration tests for the project, starting with the auth flow test. We are also continuing to understand the cell editing UI and lock mechanism implementation, which is the next task in the collaboration features roadmap according to the collab-tasks.todo file.

## Key Insights

- The application uses a decentralized architecture with Google Sheets as the source of truth and Firebase for real-time features
- Optimistic UI locking is used for concurrency control
- The project has a well-structured test suite with specific test flows
- Internationalization is implemented with support for English and Hebrew
- The collaboration features are being implemented incrementally with a clear roadmap
- The project already has a solid foundation for mocking external dependencies
- Vitest with JSDOM is the most suitable approach for fast integration tests
- The auth flow is a critical path that should be tested first
- The existing mock drivers need enhancements to better support integration testing
- A phased implementation approach will allow for incremental progress and feedback

## Integration Testing Plan

We have created a comprehensive plan for implementing integration tests:

1. **Setup and Infrastructure** (1-2 days)

   - Create integration test directory structure
   - Enhance mock drivers
   - Configure Vitest for integration tests

2. **Auth Flow Tests** (1-2 days)

   - Implement "happy path" login test
   - Implement error handling tests
   - Implement presence management tests

3. **Table Operations Tests** (2-3 days)

   - Implement conflict management tests
   - Implement role management tests
   - Implement motivation management tests

4. **Collaboration Tests** (2-3 days)

   - Implement presence visualization tests
   - Implement cell locking tests
   - Implement multi-user interaction tests

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases** (1-2 days)

   - Implement network error tests
   - Implement API error tests
   - Implement edge case tests

6. **Test Optimization and CI/CD Integration** (1-2 days)
   - Optimize test performance
   - Set up CI/CD integration
   - Document and share knowledge

The estimated total time for implementation is 8-14 days.
