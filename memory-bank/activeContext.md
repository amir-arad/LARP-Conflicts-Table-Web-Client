### Project Context

The LARP Conflicts Table Web Client is a collaborative web application that allows multiple users to simultaneously view and edit LARP character conflicts and motivations in real-time.

### Current Task

Update System Patterns to Comply with Modern Architectural Principles

### Task Goal

To update the system patterns documentation to incorporate modern architectural principles including Hexagonal Architecture, Lean Software Development, Technical Debt Management, TDD with in-memory implementations, Fakes Instead of Mocks, and Contract Tests.

### Current Status

Completed system patterns update:

- Created three focused, practical documentation files:

  - `docs/architecture/patterns/architectural-patterns.md` - Implementation guidelines for architectural patterns
  - `docs/architecture/patterns/development-methodology.md` - Practical development principles
  - `docs/architecture/patterns/testing-strategy.md` - Concrete testing approaches

- Updated supporting documentation:

  - Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with key implementation guidelines
  - Updated `docs/architecture/patterns/README.md` to reflect the practical focus
  - Updated `docs/architecture/README.md` to reference the new documents

- Ensured documentation focuses on actionable implementation guidelines rather than theoretical concepts

### Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the architectural principles in new features
2. Gradually refactor existing code to align with the principles
3. Develop more comprehensive examples of the principles in action
4. Create training materials to help team members adopt the principles

### Notes

- The updated system patterns emphasize practical implementation over theory
- The documentation is designed to be used as a reference during development
- The principles should be applied gradually, focusing on new features first
- The documentation will evolve as we gain more experience with these principles
