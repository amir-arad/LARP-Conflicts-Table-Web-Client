## Project Status

Ongoing implementation and testing of the LARP Conflicts Table Web Client, with focus on optimizing test infrastructure and preparing for comprehensive integration testing. We've successfully implemented the Firebase mock enhancements (Week 1, Day 1-2) of our integration testing preparation plan. We've enhanced the Firebase mock with multi-user presence simulation, cell locking mechanisms, real-time update notification, and user activity simulation. We've also created detailed plans for Google Sheets mock enhancements (Week 1, Day 3-4) including stateful implementation, coordinate translation, error simulation, and integration with Firebase.
