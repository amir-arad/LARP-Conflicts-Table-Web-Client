### Current Goals

1. Collaboration Features Implementation

   - Verify and fix lock visualization functionality using Storybook tests
   - Implement Storybook stories to verify lock visualization issues
   - Fix identified issues with lock visualization components
   - Complete lock mechanism for cell editing once visualization is working
   - Prepare for cursor tracking implementation
   - Ensure performance optimization for real-time features

2. Test Infrastructure Improvements

   - Implement Storybook stories for all UI components and flows

   - Transition from integration tests to Storybook for UI testing
   - Establish pattern for interactive Storybook tests

3. Documentation Structure Improvements
   - Reorganize documentation into logical feature areas
   - Improve discoverability through clear folder hierarchy
   - Establish consistent naming conventions
   - Create main documentation index for easier navigation

### Completed Milestones

- Firebase infrastructure for collaboration
- Presence system implementation
- UI components for lock visualization (potentially not functioning correctly)
- Storybook testing strategy established
- Lock visualization test plan created
- Revised implementation priority documented
- Documentation reorganization plan created

### Open Questions

1. Lock Visualization Issues

   - Why are lock indicators not visible to users?
   - Is the issue with conditional rendering, CSS specificity, or data flow?
   - Are locks being correctly passed to the UI components?
   - Is there a z-index issue with tooltips?

2. Storybook Testing Implementation

   - How to best structure interaction tests in Storybook?
   - What additional addons might be needed for comprehensive testing?
   - How to handle complex multi-user scenarios in Storybook?
   - How to simulate real-time Firebase updates in Storybook?

3. Collaboration Performance Considerations

   - Optimization strategies for many concurrent users
   - Lock conflict resolution strategies
   - State synchronization approach
   - Debouncing strategy for cursor position updates
