### Open Questions

1. Lock Visualization Issues

   - Why are lock indicators not visible to users?
   - Are the lock indicators implemented but not being triggered correctly?
   - Is there a styling or conditional rendering issue?

2. Storybook Testing Implementation

   - How to best structure interaction tests in Storybook?
